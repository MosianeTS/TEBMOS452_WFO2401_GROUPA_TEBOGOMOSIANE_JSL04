# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator


**Challenge Scenario:** In this coding exercise, I worked with ternary operators in JavaScript. I had to use ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks. 
The decisions of each challenge are displayed in the console.

## Reflections
It was quite an easy exercise for me as I have come across ternary operators before.
